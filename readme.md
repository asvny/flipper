# Flipper 

> Flipper is a game of lights. It consists of a grid of lights, in which random lights are turned ON. The gameplay is to turn ON all the grid lights. On pressing a grid, it will toggle the current and neighboring four grid lights. The best score is based on the timing and the minimal number of moves. The complexity of the app increases as you advance each range of levels by incrementing the number of grids.
